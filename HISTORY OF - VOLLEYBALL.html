    <b>ORIGINS</b>
    <p>
        History has it that William G. Morgan, who invented the game of volleyball in 1895, came up with the idea so that people who found basketball’s ‘bumping’ or ‘jolting’ too strenuous could have an alternative physical activity to fall back on. William G. Morgan, who served as the physical director at the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) Holyoke, Massachusetts, looked at the sports around and picked the aspects that he thought suited his brief the best. The ball came from basketball, the net from tennis and the use of hands from handball. While this made up a game of volleyball, it was lent some competitive tone with the introduction of innings - later to be called sets - that was borrowed from baseball. Morgan introduced the sport -- called mintonette, the original name of volleyball -- at the YMCA Physical Director's Conference a year later at Springfield College, Massachusetts. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

    <b>POPULARIZATION</b>
    <p>
        Volleyball was first introduced to the Olympic Games in 1964, and the first Olympic volleyball tournament was held in Tokyo, Japan. The United States won the gold medal in both the men's and women's tournaments. This was a major turning point for volleyball, as it helped to raise the sport's profile and popularity around the world. In the years since 1964, volleyball has continued to grow in popularity. Today, it is one of the most popular sports in the world, with millions of players in over 200 countries. Volleyball is a great way to get exercise and have fun, and it is a sport that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and abilities. There are many reasons why volleyball has become so popular. One reason is that the game is relatively easy to learn and play. The basic rules are simple, and all you need is a ball and a net. This makes volleyball a great option for people who are new to sports or who are looking for a fun and active activity to do with friends and family.  <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
